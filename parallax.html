        <p>The Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) is the most numerous tiger subspecies in Asia, and was estimated at fewer
            than 2,500 individuals by 2011. Since 2008, it is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List and is threatened
            by poaching, loss and fragmentation of habitat. None of the Tiger Conservation Landscapes within its range is
            considered large enough to support an effective population of more than 250 adult individuals. The tiger arrived
            in the Indian subcontinent about 12,000 years ago.India's tiger population was estimated at 1,706–1,909 individuals
            in 2010. By 2014, the population had reputedly increased to an estimated 2,226 individuals. Around 440 tigers
            are estimated in Bangladesh, 163–253 tigers in Nepal and 103 tigers in Bhutan. The Bengal tiger ranks among the
            biggest wild cats alive today. It is therefore considered to belong to the world's charismatic megafauna. It
            is the national animal of both India and Bangladesh.</p>

    <div class="twotext jumbotron">
        <p>The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Gate, the one-mile-wide (1.6 km) strait connecting San
            Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The structure links the American city of San Francisco, California – the
            northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula – to Marin County, carrying both U.S. Route 101 and California State
            Route 1 across the strait. The bridge is one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco,
            California, and the United States. It has been declared one of the Wonders of the Modern World by the American
            Society of Civil Engineers. The Frommer's travel guide describes the Golden Gate Bridge as "possibly the most
            beautiful, certainly the most photographed, bridge in the world." At the time of its opening in 1937, it was
            both the longest and the tallest suspension bridge in the world, with a main span of 4,200 feet (1,280 m) and
            a total height of 746 feet (227 m). Today, the Golden Gate Bridge is neither the longest nor the tallest in the
            world, but remains the tallest bridge in the United States.</p>

    <div class="fourtext jumbotron">
        <p>In the cruise world, bigger means more: more amenities, more days at sea, and of course, more people. Now, MSC Cruises
            just said it's going all-in on more by placing an order for its biggest cruise ship ever—and it'll fit the most
            passengers of any cruise ship on Earth. Called MSC's World Class, the new fleet of ships, built by STX France,
            will host 2,750 cabins, for a total maximum occupancy of 6,850 guests. The world's current largest cruise ship,
            Royal Caribbean's Harmony of the Seas, fits 6,780 at its maximum occupancy. For perspective: a little over 100
            years ago, the world's largest ship, the ill-fated Titanic, fit only 2,344 passengers—about a third of the size
            of MSC's new World Class. Currently, MSC has orders with STX France for two ships, to be inaugurated in 2022
            and 2024, with options for two more ships in 2025 and 2026. The boats' dimensions are quite staggering, measuring
            1,082 feet by 154 feet. For comparison, an American football field is 360 feet by 160 feet, so each ship is nearly
            the size of three football fields. They'll also contain a massive 200,000 GRT—that's gross register tons, or
            the total volume permanently enclosed inside the ship. In other words, that's a lot—but just slightly behind
            Harmony of the Seas' 226,963 GRT.

    <div class="fivetext jumbotron">
        <p>The Colosseum or Coliseum (/kɒləˈsiːəm/ kol-ə-SEE-əm), also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum
            Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio [aŋfiteˈaːtro ˈflaːvjo] or Colosseo [kolosˈsɛːo]), is an oval amphitheatre
            in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy. Built of travertine, tuff, and brick-faced concrete it is the largest
            amphitheatre ever built. The Colosseum is situated just east of the Roman Forum. Construction began under the
            emperor Vespasian in AD 72, and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir Titus. Further modifications
            were made during the reign of Domitian (81–96). These three emperors are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the
            amphitheatre was named in Latin for its association with their family name (Flavius). The Colosseum could hold,
            it is estimated, between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators, having an average audience of some 65,000; it was used
            for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as mock sea battles (for only a short time as the hypogeum
            was soon filled in with mechanisms to support the other activities), animal hunts, executions, re-enactments
            of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology. The building ceased to be used for entertainment
            in the early medieval era. It was later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a religious
            order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.</p>
